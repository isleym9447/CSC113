Content -- This is administrative and social tasks. Things that anyone can probably do (although some are better at them than others), but there's a big benefit to automating them. Examples:
Social media promotions for your business
Writing lesson plans and course outlines for a course you're teaching
Taking a collection of notes and turning it into an organized document, with notes on what is most important
Summarizing a long board meeting into an executive memo.
Art -- Stories, images, poetry. These things have no "right answer", so the trick is more capturing the feeling or theme you want to create. Examples:
An attractive poster for a club meeting
A children's book with text and pictures
A collection of poetry about your pets
A short skit you can perform with your friends
Programming -- Both programmers and non-programmers can learn to prompt LLMs to write programs for them, but the approaches and challenges will differ. If you want to write a really complicated program using generative AI, you'll need to work with the tool. Examples:
Creating a simple "snake" game in Python without knowing how to write code
Having a model create functions for you after you fully describe their inputs and outputs
Using a model to explain code to you
Experimental -- There's things we know and thing we know that we don't know, but these are "unknown unknowns". In other words, there are uses for generative AI that nobody has discovered yet! This may involve combining tools in different ways.
